Creating A Hello World App


Creating a "Hello World" app is a common starting point in many programming languages, like C#, C, or C++. Similarly, in Flutter, I followed a simple process to build my first application. First, I set up the environment by installing the Flutter SDK and configuring Visual Studio Code with the Flutter extension and Dart plugin. Next, I created a new Flutter project, which generated a default project structure, including the main entry point, lib/main.dart. In this file, I wrote the code to display "Hello, World!" on the screen, using widgets like MaterialApp, Scaffold, and Text. After completing the code, I ran the application using the terminal command flutter run or the Run option in VS Code. The app launched successfully, showing "Hello, World!" centered on the screen. This exercise helped me understand the fundamentals of Flutter, including its project structure and widget-based framework.
